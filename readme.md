# In browser Tic Tac Toe
I was reading Janie Clayton's game dev journal ( http://redqueengamedev.com/category/game-dev-journal/ ) and realized I have never coded an implementation of a game. Ever. In all my years as a developer. I've also never written Swift. I figured I should keep _new_ stuff minimized in a toy project like this. So I translated her break down of game states and what not into vanilla JS.

Janie's blog is awesome. You should check it out. And the associated repo can be found at https://github.com/RedQueenCoder/RedQueenGameDev You should check that out too.
